### How you can help
 
There's a lot I need help with, not just coding. So if you have enthusiasm, experience or aspirations for any of the following, please jump in:

 -  User Experience (user interface and user design)
 -  Accessibility (see https://pages.18f.gov/accessibility/)
 -  Suggesting features
 -  Advocacy (if you just think this is just the absolute best thing ever made, tell ur friends!)
 -  Improve knowledge base (documentation)
 -  Make suggestions to improve code (code review)
 -  Or even go ahead and refactor the code!
 -  Improve test coverage
 -  Code review - tell me where I can improve!


### Getting Started
 
Here are the instructions for getting the code and getting the application working on your machine.


####Set up####

pmc-ref uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/), [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) and [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/). Versions used are Node 4.2.6 and Mongo 3.2. Heroku Toolbelt is not strictly necessary and without it this app can still be run locally. But this is hosted on Heroku and it just helps a little way to ensure any changes still work with it.


####Loading test data into MongoDB####

With Node, MongoDB and Heroku installed download and unzip the current data set data from [here]()(64MB).

In a terminal start mongod running with `mongod` and in a new terminal navigate to the unzipped files.

From there run the command 

`mongorestore -d [desired name of database] path/to/unzipped/data/`

Start an instance of mongo with the `mongo` command and check there is some data.

`db.articlemodels.find({"doi":"10.1038/nature10158"})`

`db.journalmodels.find({"title":"Nature"})`

Log an issue if you need help.

####Up and running####

Once the test data has been loaded, clone or fork this repo and run `npm install` from the root. There are some known issues with node-gyp and Kerberos which are related to Mongo and/or Mongoose but it  "should" be ok.

If installing on Windows these instructions might be useful for deciphering install errors https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation too.

Check the mongod process is still running.

Once you have everything open app.js and uncomment line `mongoose.connect(config.mongoose.host);` and comment out the  line`mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGOLAB_URI);`. Yup. Working on config and environment stuff.

If not using Heroku use the command `MONGOOSE_HOST=mongodb://localhost/[desired name of database] node main.js` to start the Node process.

If using Heroku:

`heroku local web -f Procfile.test` or create a .env file, add 'MONGOOSE_HOST=mongodb://localhost/[desired na...blah]' and just run `heroku local`. It will default to port 5000.

Open the browser at localhost:5000 and start using the API!



On Windows:

- Start the mongod server: `mongod`

- In a new terminal cd to the project directory which will contain main.js and set the following:

`set MONGOOSE_HOST=mongodb://localhost/`,
`set MONGOOSE_DB=pmcref`,
`set SERVER_PORT=1337`,

- run the command

`node main.js %MONGOOSE_HOST% %MONGOOSE_DB% %SERVER_PORT%`

- open browser at [http://localhost:1337/](http://localhost:1337/)


### Tests

Here's where you can find out more information on running and writing tests.

pmc-ref using the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and a bit of [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) to write and run tests. 

Tests can be run using the command:

`npm test`
